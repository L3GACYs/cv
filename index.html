      <p> <em> Student of Web Development <br> Redding, CA 96022 </em></p>
      <p>I am a brand new Student of Web Development, my past professions have been
        in the Law Enforcement and Medical field; even though I loved parts of
        these jobs it has always seemed there was something missing to them. I am
        currently only using online resources and books to self-teach myself. I am very
        passionate about learning
        all kinds of web and software development. There is no
        particular direction I am wanting to go at this point and am keeping and
        open mind about what I want to specialize in. </p>

        <li><em>This is something I've been doing since I was very young. I joined

          made my way all the way to the highest rank achievable, a Eagle Scout.

          interest in it through the years</em></li>

    <li>Jiu Jitsu</li>
      <ul>

        in. I have started to take lessons at a facility called <a

        as learn a new skill</em></li>
      </ul>
  </ol>
 <!-- this my very first real problem ive come across where I had to do some
   troubleshooting. Due to incorrect indentation during me making my lists and
   sublists my second header was coming out indented and the flow of the page
   was off. I had to delete all the code I had in place and go back to MDN and
   find out what the correct indentation in lists and sublists was. This seems
   trivial but was very perplexing for me and took quite a while for me to work
   through. -->
